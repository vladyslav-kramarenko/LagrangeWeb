This is a JavaScript web application for performing polynomial interpolation using the Lagrange method. 
Given a set of initial data points, this application calculates and displays the simplified polynomial interpolation function, along with an interactive chart to visualize the interpolation.

## Getting Started
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can also host it on a web server for online access.

### Prerequisites
No special prerequisites are required to run this application. It should work in most modern web browsers.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter your initial data points in the table provided. Each row should contain an X and Y value.
Click the "+" button to add more data points or the "-" button to remove a data point.
Once you have entered your data, click the "Calculate" button to perform the polynomial interpolation.
The simplified polynomial interpolation function will be displayed below the chart.
## Features
Polynomial interpolation using the Lagrange method.
Dynamic addition and removal of data points.
Visualization of the interpolation function using an interactive chart.
Detection of duplicate X-values in the input data.
## Files
index.html: The main HTML file containing the user interface and form for entering data.
css/style.css: CSS file for styling the application.
css/bootstrap.min.css: CSS file for Bootstrap framework (used for styling).
